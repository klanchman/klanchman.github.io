    <h2>Who I Am</h2>

    <h3>Software Developer...</h3>
    <p>
        I'm a software developer, and I love what I do. I enjoy working on all sorts of projects, especially mobile and full-stack web application development.
        People interact with all kinds of software every day. It's my goal to ensure when they use anything I wrote, they have the best experience possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whenever I find some spare time and I have an urge to create something, I like to work on personal side projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes it's just something small, like using my Raspberry Pi to automate my lights and camera based on my location and the time of day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other times it's a full-blown application. I worked on an iOS app for Reddit for a while. I got pretty far along, but between more apps being released and Reddit changing how to access their API, I decided to stop. Yet I find myself wanting more out of these other apps. I might restart this project soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've also been working on a iOS app for <a href="https://myanimelist.net">MyAnimeList</a>, because there aren't too many, and I'm not a big fan of the ones that exist.
        There probably isn't a huge market for this app, but I'm doing it more for fun and my own use than anything. Still, I want to launch it on the App Store once it's ready!
    </p>

    <h3>...And a Bit More</h3>
    <p>
        Besides software development, I'm interested in learning more about user interface and graphic design.
        I have a deep appreciation for applications that have a clean and functional interface. Whenever I am working on the UI for a project, my goal is to make it something that I would enjoy using myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also have an interest in system administration and DevOps. I've managed systems in an office environment, I love my ever-growing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/">homelab</a>, and I like setting up CI/CD for work projects and side projects.
    </p>

    <h3>Tech Enthusiast</h3>
    <p>
        I love just about anything related to technology. I'm always reading about new technologies, languages, frameworks, and tools. It's so satisfying to find new tech to learn about and try out.
    </p>

    <h3>Warranty Voider</h3>
    <p>
        I love to experiment with my devices to see what I can do with them. I've voided the warranty on nearly every device I've owned, usually through software modifications.
    </p>
    <p>
        It started with an MP3 player: I flashed a customizable 3rd party firmware on it. Later I started using Android phones. I rooted and flashed custom ROMs on every one of them. Then I got an iPhone, so I just <em>had</em> to jailbreak it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lately I haven't been voiding warranties though, instead hacking away on a Raspberry Pi or in a vSphere VM.
    </p>

    <h3>Writer and Photographer?</h3>
    <p>
        Well, sort of. I enjoy things other than tech, too. (I swear!)
    </p>
    <p>
        I really like writing; I keep a small blog that I update occasionally when I think of something I want to write about. Admittedly, those updates are very infrequent. I'm trying to get back on track.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also enjoy photography, though I'm not particularly good at it. I try to bring my camera whenever I know I could see something interesting, but usually I'll make do with my phone's camera.
