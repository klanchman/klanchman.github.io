    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <h3>Software Developer...</h3>
    <p>I'm a software developer, and I love what I do. I enjoy working on a range of projects, from web development to desktop application development. I'm most interested in mobile development, though. Mobile devices are becoming more prevalent, and are becoming more important in our daily lives. Because of this, the importance of creating great software for these devices will only become more important as time goes on.</p>
    <p>Whenever I find some spare time and I have an urge to create something, I like to work on some personal side projects.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it's just something like learning a new language or framework, or maybe automating my lights and cameras based on my location and time of day.</p>
    <p>Other times it's a full-blown application. I worked on an iOS app for <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> for a while. I stopped after more apps continued to come out and Reddit switched over to OAuth, but I find myself wanting more out of these other apps. I might get back into it after all.</p>
    <p>I've also been working on a iOS app for <a href="https://myanimelist.net">MyAnimeList</a>, seeing as there aren't too many and I'm not a fan of the ones that exist. There probably isn't a huge market for it, but I'm doing it more for my own sanity and fun than anything.</p>
    <h3>...And a Bit More</h3>
    <p>Besides software development, I'm interested in learning more about user interface and graphic design. I really enjoy applications that have a clean and functional interface. Whenever I am working on the UI for a project, my goal is to make it something that I would <em>want</em> to use myself.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy system administration and DevOps. I've managed systems in an office environment, I love to manage my ever-growing homelab, and I enjoy setting up CI/CD for work projects and side projects alike.</p>
    <h3>Tech Enthusiast</h3>
    <p>I love just about anything related to technology. I'm always reading about new technologies and tools, and I love learning about and using ones that I'm really interested in.</p>
    <h3>Warranty Voider</h3>
    <p>Simply put, I like to tinker. I've voided the warranty on nearly every device I've owned, usually through software modifications. (Of course, I'm always cautious enough to prevent ruining my devices.)</p>
    <p>Early on, I did what I could with what I had. An MP3 player, for instance: I flashed a customizable 3rd party firmware on it. I went on to root and flash custom ROMs on every Android device that I've owned, and I jailbroke some of my iOS devices. I love to experiment with my devices to see what I can do with them.</p>
    <p>Lately I've been voiding warranties less often, instead hacking away on things like my Raspberry Pi or a vSphere VM.</p>
    <h3>Writer, Photographer, and Musician?</h3>
    <p>Well, sort of. I enjoy things other than tech, too. (I swear!)</p>
    <p>I really enjoy writing; I keep a small blog that I update occasionally when I think of something I want to write about. Admittedly, that doesn't happen as much as I'd like. I'm trying to get back on track with this one.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy photography, though I'm not particularly good at it. I need to find some more time to devote to that.</p>
    <p>I deeply enjoy music, mostly listening but sometimes playing. I have an electronic drum kit, and I hope to get an acoustic set eventually (once I live someplace I won't disturb so many people by playing it)!</p>
